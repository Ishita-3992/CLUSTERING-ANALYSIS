We are performing cluster analysis on dataset: :Wholsale customers data

#3 methods used are:

#K-MEANS:

Divides the dataset into a fixed number of clusters (K) by minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and cluster centroids.
The number of clusters (K) must be pre-defined.

#Hierarchical Clustering:

Hierarchical methods create a hierarchy of clusters that can be represented in a tree-like
structure called a dendrogram.

#MEAN SHIFTING:

It is a density-based algorithm that iteratively shifts each data point toward the densest 
region of data, effectively "shifting" points toward cluster centers.

Detailed preprocessing has been done and the resuls have beeen compiled into a analysis report with graphs
