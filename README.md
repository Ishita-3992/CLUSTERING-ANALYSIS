We are performing cluster analyis on dataset: :Wholseale customers data
#3 methods used are:
#K-MEANS:
Divides the dataset into a fixed number of clusters (K) by minimizing the sum of squared distances between
data points and cluster centroids.
The number of clusters (K) must be pre-defined.
#Hierarchical Clustering:
Hierarchical methods create a hierarchy of clusters that can be represented in a tree-like
structure called a dendrogram.
#MEAN SHIFTING:
It is a density-based algorithm that iteratively shifts each data point toward the densest 
region of data, effectively "shifting" points toward cluster centers.
